// Tutorial-as-test harness (plan 30 §8.3). A tutorial is an ordered list of steps; each step has a
// `title` (becomes the doc heading), a `narration` (the line BAM records — see
// plans/31-tutorial-narration-scripts.md), and an `action` that drives the page. Running a tutorial
// under playwright.tutorial.config.ts produces, per flow, in tutorial-output/<slug>/:
//   marks.json   — [{ n, title, narration, startMs, endMs }] wall-clock timing of every step
//   step-NN.png  — a full-page screenshot at the END of each step
//   video path   — recorded by the config (video: "on"); marks.json stores its location
// scripts/tutorial-video/gen-docs.mjs turns that into docs/tutorials/<slug>.md;
// scripts/tutorial-video/compose.mjs + BAM's step-NN audio files turn it into a narrated mp4.
//
// The narration field is part of the CONTRACT, not decoration: compose.mjs stretches each step's
// screen time to the length of its recorded audio, keyed by step number. Keep step order stable
// once audio is recorded; append rather than reorder.
